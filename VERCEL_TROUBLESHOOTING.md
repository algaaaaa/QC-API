# 🔧 Vercel Troubleshooting - Fixed!

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Function Invocation Failed

### **Problem:**
```
500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
```

### **Root Cause:**
Vercel serverless functions couldn't import middleware from separate files due to how Vercel bundles serverless functions.

### **Solution Applied:**
✅ **Inlined all middleware** directly into `api/index.js`
- API key authentication
- Rate limiters
- Input validators

This ensures all dependencies are bundled together in the serverless function.

## 🚀 Fixed and Deployed

The fix has been:
1. ✅ Applied to `api/index.js`
2. ✅ Committed to GitHub
3. ✅ Pushed to repository

### **Next Steps:**

Vercel will automatically redeploy your function. Wait 1-2 minutes, then test:

**1. Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://your-project.vercel.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "platform": "Vercel"
}
```

**2. Test API (No Auth Required for Health):**
```bash
curl https://your-project.vercel.app/
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "message": "QC Image API - Vercel Deployment",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "status": "active"
}
```

**3. Test with API Key:**
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://your-project.vercel.app/api/qc-images?id=7494645791"
```

## 📊 What Changed

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// Tried to import from separate files
const validateApiKey = require('./middleware/auth');
const { generalLimiter } = require('./middleware/rateLimiter');
// ❌ Failed because Vercel couldn't find these files
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// All middleware inlined in api/index.js
function validateApiKey(req, res, next) { ... }
const generalLimiter = rateLimit({ ... });
// ✅ Works because everything is in one file
```
